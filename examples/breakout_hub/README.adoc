= Ethernet breakout board hub

This directory contains an example design for a 4-port hub. It runs on an
https://www.olimex.com/Products/FPGA/iCE40/iCE40HX8K-EVB/[Olimex iCE40HX8K-EVB]
combined with an ethernet breakout board.

To compile this design, run

    $ make examples/breakout_hub/top.bin

from the root directory of this repository. NextPNR can't always reliably place
and route this design (due to heavy I/O congestion), so you may need to run
this multiple times.
